# Arabic Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

  A machine learning project focused on analyzing Arabic text to determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). This project tackles the unique challenges of processing Arabic text using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.



# Features

  ‚Ä¢	Classifies Arabic text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Preprocesses Arabic text to handle stop words, tokenization, and normalization.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Utilizes machine learning algorithms and deep learning models for sentiment analysis.



# Technologies Used
  ‚Ä¢	Programming Language: Python
  
  ‚Ä¢	Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK
  
  ‚Ä¢	NLP Techniques: Tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal, and text vectorization



# Installation
  **1. Clone the Repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/Malakismail/Arabic-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP.git
    cd Arabic-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP

  **2. Install Dependencies:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

  **3. Prepare the Dataset:**
   ‚Ä¢	Use a dataset with labeled Arabic text for training and testing.
   ‚Ä¢	Place the dataset in the data/ directory.

  **4. Run the Project:**
  
    # Train the model: 
          python train_model.py
          
    # Test the model:
          python test_model.py



# Usage
  1. Preprocess Arabic text to clean and normalize input data.
  2. Train the sentiment analysis model using the provided scripts.
  3. Predict sentiment for new Arabic text inputs using the trained model.



# Future Improvements
  ‚Ä¢	Enhance performance using transformer-based models such as BERT or GPT for Arabic text.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Expand the model to support multilingual sentiment analysis.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Develop a web-based or mobile application for user-friendly interaction.
